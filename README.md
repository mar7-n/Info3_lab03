# Part 0: Python Project Ideas Pitch and Group Selection
Bring your Project Ideas to the Lab. You can pitch your project ideas in the beginning of the lab and form teams based on interest just for this project.

For inspiration read through the Table of Contents of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart.

# Part 1: Use Cases
Clarify the goals of your project with a use case diagram and textual description of the use case. Use the examples in the slides as a guideline.

Your project does not need to be large, but complex enough to need at least one command line parameter.

# Part 2: Brief Design
Even with small scripts it may be useful to do a bit of up-front design. Write down some pseudocode, identify methods, maybe even classes. Feel free to use simple class and sequence diagrams for the design.

Use argparse to read the parameters from the command line.

# Part 3: Development
Set up a Git(hub) repository and write your script!

# Part 4: For the bored
How do you test your script? Can you write Unit Tests for it?
